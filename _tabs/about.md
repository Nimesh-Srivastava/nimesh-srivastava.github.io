I am a software development engineer currently employed as a full stack developer for iOS applications. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in AI and ML.

This blog contains all of my side projects that I create outside of work.

I like to try out different technologies in different fields like crypto development, Web v3.0, CyberSecurity, AGI, Quantum Computing, etc.
