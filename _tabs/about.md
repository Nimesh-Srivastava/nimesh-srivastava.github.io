I am a software development engineer currently employed as a full stack developer for iOS applications. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in AI and ML. This blog contains all of my side projects that I create outside of work. I like to try out different technologies in different fields including but not limited to CryptoCurrency, CyberSecurity, AGI, QuantumComputing, etc.
