## Introduction

This guide will server as an introduction to ANNs. We will build a neural network from scratch without using any specialised libraries like keras or pytorch. We will only use NumPy and Pandas for matrix operations and other maths functions.

The best way to learn about ANN is to solve a real world problem. We will try to solve a classification problem using a neural network.

## The Problem

We will be tackling the problem of digit classification. We will be given a grayscale image of a handwritten digit (between 0 nad 9) and out goal is to correctly identify it. This is a beginner level problem and is ideal for understanding the workings of a neural net.

The dataset that we will use is known as MNIST dataset. It is provided on Kaggle. Use the link below to download it.

## About the Dataset

The dataset consits of thousands of images of handwritten digits. Each image is grayscale, and it has fixed dimensions of 28x28 pixels. So all in all, each image is 784 pixels of values ranging from 0 to 255. Since all the images are grayscale, we need not worry about pixel colours. Each pixel can only have values between 0 and 255.

## Matrix Representations

Lets assume we have **m** images.
If we represent our dataset as a matrix, then we have a matrix of dimensions **m x 784**, where rows are representing the number of images and columns are representing the number of pixels in each image. Let's denote this matrix by **X**.

We will now take transpose of this matrix. We do this so that future calculations are made easy for us. This is a completely optional step and it's only purpose is ease of calculations.
So, now we have a matrix of dimensions **784 x m**, where each image is now represented in a column instead of a row.

## Creating the Neural Net

We will build a very simple neural network that will only have 3 layers in total. The 0th layer is called the input layer, and the last layer is called the output layer. Since, input layer neurons do not have any calculations associated with them, we say that our model only has 2 computational layers, i.e., 1 hidden and 1 output.

The input layer will consist of 784 neurons, representing 784 pixels in an image. The hidden layer will have 10 neurons, and the outout layer will also have 10 neurons, representing the digits 0 to 9. And so, our model diagram will look something like this :

## Training the ANN

There are 3 parts to training a neural net, 1) feed forward, 2) activation function, 3) back propagation.

1. **Feed forward** : Take an input image => run through the network => compute the output.
