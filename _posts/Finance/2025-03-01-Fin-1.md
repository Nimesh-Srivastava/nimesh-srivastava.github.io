# Chapter 1: Introduction to Quantitative Trading

## The Revolution That Changed Finance Forever

In the summer of 1988, a group of physicists and mathematicians at Renaissance Technologies began developing what would become one of the most successful trading strategies in history. Using complex mathematical models and massive computational power, they created algorithms that could predict price movements with unprecedented accuracy. Their flagship Medallion Fund would go on to generate average annual returns of over 35% for three decades, establishing quantitative trading as the dominant force in modern finance.

Today, quantitative trading accounts for over 80% of all equity trading volume in the United States. From the towering glass offices of Goldman Sachs to the sprawling data centers of Two Sigma, armies of mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists work tirelessly to find patterns in the seemingly random movements of financial markets. This is the world of quantitative trading—a domain where mathematics meets money, where algorithms execute billions of dollars in trades in milliseconds, and where success is measured not by gut instinct but by statistical significance.

## What Is Quantitative Trading?

Quantitative trading, often called "quant trading" or "algorithmic trading," is the practice of using mathematical models, statistical analysis, and computational algorithms to make investment decisions. Unlike traditional discretionary trading, where human traders make decisions based on intuition, experience, and subjective analysis, quantitative trading removes human emotion and bias from the equation, relying instead on data-driven, systematic approaches to identify and exploit market opportunities.

### The Core Philosophy

At its heart, quantitative trading is built on a simple but powerful premise: financial markets, despite their apparent randomness, contain patterns and inefficiencies that can be discovered through rigorous mathematical analysis and exploited for profit. These patterns might be subtle—perhaps certain stocks tend to move together in predictable ways, or maybe market volatility follows cyclical patterns that can be forecast. The key is that these patterns are not obvious to the casual observer; they emerge only through sophisticated statistical analysis of vast amounts of data.

Consider this analogy: Imagine you're trying to predict the weather by looking at clouds. A traditional forecaster might step outside, look at the sky, and make a prediction based on experience and intuition. A quantitative meteorologist, by contrast, would collect data from thousands of weather stations, satellite images, atmospheric pressure readings, and historical weather patterns, then feed all this information into complex mathematical models to generate predictions. The quantitative approach isn't always right, but over time, it tends to be more accurate and consistent than human intuition alone.

### The Mathematical Foundation

Every quantitative trading strategy begins with a hypothesis—a mathematical statement about how markets behave. For example:

**Hypothesis**: "Stocks that have performed poorly over the past month tend to outperform the market over the following month."

This hypothesis can be expressed mathematically as:

```
E[R(t+1) | R(t) < μ - σ] > E[R(t+1)]
```

Where:
- E[R(t+1)] represents the expected return in the next period
- R(t) represents the current period return
- μ is the average return
- σ is the standard deviation of returns

Once we have a mathematical hypothesis, we can test it rigorously using historical data. If the hypothesis holds up to statistical scrutiny—if we can demonstrate that the pattern is statistically significant and not just random noise—then we can build a trading strategy around it.

## The Evolution of Quantitative Trading

### The Early Pioneers (1960s-1980s)

The roots of quantitative trading can be traced back to the 1960s when academic researchers began applying mathematical models to financial markets. Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory, introduced in 1952, provided the first rigorous mathematical framework for portfolio construction. His work showed that investors could reduce risk without sacrificing returns by diversifying their portfolios according to mathematical principles.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by William Sharpe, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin in the 1960s, further formalized the relationship between risk and return:

```
E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) - Rf]
```

This equation states that the expected return of any asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium proportional to the asset's beta (its correlation with the overall market).

In 1973, Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton published their groundbreaking work on options pricing, providing the first complete mathematical model for valuing derivatives:

```
C = S₀N(d₁) - Ke^(-rT)N(d₂)
```

This Black-Scholes formula revolutionized derivatives trading and demonstrated that complex financial instruments could be priced using sophisticated mathematical models.

### The Computer Revolution (1980s-1990s)

The widespread adoption of computers in the 1980s opened new possibilities for quantitative trading. For the first time, traders could process vast amounts of data quickly and execute complex mathematical calculations in real-time. This period saw the emergence of the first systematic trading strategies and the founding of legendary quantitative hedge funds.

D.E. Shaw & Co., founded by computer scientist David Shaw in 1988, was one of the first firms to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to trading. The firm's approach was revolutionary: instead of hiring traditional Wall Street traders, Shaw recruited scientists and engineers from top universities and technology companies.

Around the same time, Jim Simons, a former mathematics professor and code-breaker for the National Security Agency, founded Renaissance Technologies. Simons assembled a team of mathematicians, physicists, and statisticians who approached trading as a purely scientific endeavor. They built massive databases of market data, developed sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms, and created automated trading systems that could operate without human intervention.

### The Modern Era (2000s-Present)

The advent of electronic trading platforms, high-speed internet, and big data analytics has transformed quantitative trading into a highly sophisticated, technology-driven industry. Today's quantitative trading firms operate like technology companies, with teams of data scientists, software engineers, and quantitative researchers working together to develop increasingly complex trading algorithms.

Modern quantitative trading encompasses several distinct approaches:

**High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: These strategies execute thousands or millions of trades per day, holding positions for seconds or minutes. HFT firms like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial use cutting-edge technology to identify and exploit tiny price discrepancies across different markets.

**Statistical Arbitrage**: These strategies identify pricing relationships between different securities and profit when these relationships deviate from their historical norms. For example, if two similar stocks typically move together but temporarily diverge, a statistical arbitrage strategy might buy the underperforming stock and sell the outperforming one, betting that they will converge again.

**Factor Investing**: These strategies systematically invest in stocks based on specific characteristics or "factors" that have been shown to drive returns. Common factors include value (buying cheap stocks), momentum (buying stocks that have been rising), and quality (buying stocks of companies with strong fundamentals).

**Machine Learning Strategies**: The latest frontier in quantitative trading involves using artificial intelligence and machine learning to discover patterns in data that are too complex for traditional statistical methods. These strategies might analyze satellite imagery to predict crop yields, process news articles to gauge market sentiment, or use deep learning networks to identify subtle patterns in price movements.

## The Anatomy of a Quantitative Trading Strategy

To understand how quantitative trading works in practice, let's examine the key components of a typical strategy:

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

Every quantitative strategy begins with data. This might include:

**Price Data**: Historical prices, volumes, and other market data for stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives.

**Fundamental Data**: Financial statements, earnings reports, economic indicators, and other information about companies and markets.

**Alternative Data**: Satellite imagery, social media sentiment, credit card transactions, web scraping data, and other non-traditional information sources.

The quality and scope of data often determine the success of a quantitative strategy. Renaissance Technologies, for example, is rumored to collect data on everything from weather patterns to Google search trends, believing that any information that might affect market prices could be valuable.

### 2. Signal Generation

Once we have data, the next step is to generate trading signals—mathematical indicators that tell us when to buy or sell. These signals are based on the patterns and relationships we've discovered in our data analysis.

For example, a simple momentum signal might be:

```python
def momentum_signal(prices, lookback_period=20):
    """
    Generate momentum signal based on past price performance
    Returns +1 for buy signal, -1 for sell signal, 0 for no signal
    """
    returns = prices.pct_change(lookback_period)
    
    # Buy if return is in top quartile, sell if in bottom quartile
    if returns > returns.quantile(0.75):
        return 1
    elif returns < returns.quantile(0.25):
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
```

More sophisticated signals might incorporate multiple factors, use machine learning algorithms, or analyze high-frequency market microstructure data.

### 3. Portfolio Construction

Once we have trading signals, we need to decide how much of each security to buy or sell. This involves several considerations:

**Position Sizing**: How much capital should we allocate to each trade? This decision must balance the potential for profit against the risk of loss.

**Risk Management**: How do we ensure that we don't take on too much risk? This might involve setting maximum position sizes, diversifying across different securities, or using hedging strategies.

**Transaction Costs**: Every trade involves costs—commissions, bid-ask spreads, market impact. We need to ensure that our expected profits exceed these costs.

A simple portfolio construction algorithm might look like this:

```python
def construct_portfolio(signals, prices, volatilities, max_position=0.05):
    """
    Construct portfolio weights based on signals and risk constraints
    """
    # Calculate raw weights based on signals
    raw_weights = signals / abs(signals).sum()
    
    # Apply volatility scaling (invest more in less volatile assets)
    vol_scaled_weights = raw_weights / volatilities
    
    # Apply position limits
    weights = np.clip(vol_scaled_weights, -max_position, max_position)
    
    # Normalize to sum to 1 (or 0 for market-neutral strategies)
    weights = weights / abs(weights).sum()
    
    return weights
```

### 4. Execution

Finally, we need to execute our trades in the market. This might seem straightforward, but it's actually one of the most complex aspects of quantitative trading. Large trades can move market prices against us, eroding our profits. We need sophisticated execution algorithms that can break large orders into smaller pieces, time our trades to minimize market impact, and adapt to changing market conditions.

## Types of Quantitative Trading Strategies

The world of quantitative trading encompasses many different approaches, each with its own philosophy, time horizon, and risk profile. Understanding these different types is crucial for anyone looking to enter the field.

### Trend Following Strategies

Trend following is perhaps the oldest and most intuitive form of quantitative trading. The basic idea is simple: identify securities that are trending in a particular direction and bet that the trend will continue.

**The Philosophy**: Markets often exhibit momentum. When a stock starts rising, it tends to keep rising (at least in the short term). This might be due to investor psychology, fundamental changes in the company's prospects, or technical factors in the market structure.

**Implementation**: A typical trend following strategy might use moving averages to identify trends:

```python
def trend_following_signal(prices, short_window=50, long_window=200):
    """
    Generate trend following signals using moving average crossover
    """
    short_ma = prices.rolling(short_window).mean()
    long_ma = prices.rolling(long_window).mean()
    
    # Buy when short MA crosses above long MA (uptrend)
    # Sell when short MA crosses below long MA (downtrend)
    signal = np.where(short_ma > long_ma, 1, -1)
    
    return signal
```

**Historical Performance**: Trend following strategies have been remarkably successful over long periods. The legendary Turtle Traders, trained by Richard Dennis in the 1980s, used simple trend following rules to generate extraordinary returns. Many of today's largest hedge funds, including Bridgewater Associates and AQR Capital Management, employ sophisticated trend following strategies.

**Challenges**: Trend following strategies can suffer during sideways or choppy markets when there are no clear trends. They also tend to give back profits during trend reversals, as they rely on backward-looking indicators.

### Mean Reversion Strategies

Mean reversion strategies operate on the opposite principle from trend following: they bet that prices will return to their long-term average values.

**The Philosophy**: Financial markets are sometimes irrational, causing prices to deviate significantly from their fair values. However, over time, these deviations tend to correct themselves as rational investors step in to exploit the mispricing.

**Implementation**: A simple mean reversion strategy might identify stocks that have moved far from their historical averages:

```python
def mean_reversion_signal(prices, lookback_period=252, threshold=2.0):
    """
    Generate mean reversion signals based on deviation from historical average
    """
    mean_price = prices.rolling(lookback_period).mean()
    std_price = prices.rolling(lookback_period).std()
    
    # Calculate z-score
    z_score = (prices - mean_price) / std_price
    
    # Buy when price is significantly below average
    # Sell when price is significantly above average
    signal = np.where(z_score < -threshold, 1, 
                     np.where(z_score > threshold, -1, 0))
    
    return signal
```

**Pairs Trading**: One of the most popular mean reversion strategies is pairs trading. This involves identifying two stocks that typically move together (perhaps companies in the same industry) and trading the spread between them:

```python
def pairs_trading_signal(price_a, price_b, lookback_period=60, threshold=2.0):
    """
    Generate pairs trading signals based on the spread between two assets
    """
    # Calculate the spread (assuming a hedge ratio of 1 for simplicity)
    spread = price_a - price_b
    
    # Calculate z-score of the spread
    mean_spread = spread.rolling(lookback_period).mean()
    std_spread = spread.rolling(lookback_period).std()
    z_score = (spread - mean_spread) / std_spread
    
    # Trade when spread deviates significantly from its mean
    # Long A, Short B when spread is below average (expecting convergence)
    # Short A, Long B when spread is above average (expecting convergence)
    signal_a = np.where(z_score < -threshold, 1,
                       np.where(z_score > threshold, -1, 0))
    signal_b = -signal_a  # Opposite position in stock B
    
    return signal_a, signal_b
```

**Challenges**: Mean reversion strategies can suffer during structural changes when the historical relationships no longer hold. They also require careful risk management, as positions can move against you before reverting to the mean.

### Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical arbitrage strategies attempt to profit from temporary price discrepancies between related securities. Unlike traditional arbitrage, which exploits riskless price differences, statistical arbitrage involves some risk but aims to profit from statistical relationships that are likely (but not guaranteed) to hold.

**The Philosophy**: In efficient markets, similar securities should have similar prices. When these relationships break down temporarily, there's an opportunity to profit by betting on their convergence.

**Implementation**: A statistical arbitrage strategy might use factor models to identify mispriced securities:

```python
def statistical_arbitrage_signal(returns, factors, lookback_period=252):
    """
    Generate statistical arbitrage signals using factor models
    """
    # Estimate factor exposures using linear regression
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    
    signals = {}
    for asset in returns.columns:
        # Fit factor model for each asset
        asset_returns = returns[asset].dropna()
        factor_data = factors.loc[asset_returns.index]
        
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(factor_data, asset_returns)
        
        # Calculate expected returns based on factor model
        expected_returns = model.predict(factor_data)
        
        # Calculate residuals (alpha)
        residuals = asset_returns - expected_returns
        
        # Generate signals based on residual z-scores
        residual_zscore = (residuals - residuals.mean()) / residuals.std()
        signals[asset] = -residual_zscore  # Buy when residual is negative (underpriced)
    
    return pd.DataFrame(signals)
```

### Market Making

Market making strategies provide liquidity to the market by continuously quoting bid and ask prices. Market makers profit from the bid-ask spread while taking on inventory risk.

**The Philosophy**: Markets need liquidity to function efficiently. Market makers provide this liquidity and are compensated through the bid-ask spread. The key is to manage inventory risk and adverse selection costs.

**Implementation**: A simple market making strategy might look like this:

```python
def market_making_strategy(mid_price, volatility, inventory, risk_aversion=0.1):
    """
    Calculate optimal bid and ask quotes for market making
    """
    # Base spread based on volatility and risk aversion
    base_spread = risk_aversion * volatility
    
    # Adjust spread based on inventory (wider spread when holding more inventory)
    inventory_adjustment = risk_aversion * abs(inventory) * volatility
    
    # Calculate bid and ask prices
    bid_price = mid_price - base_spread/2 - inventory_adjustment * np.sign(inventory)
    ask_price = mid_price + base_spread/2 - inventory_adjustment * np.sign(inventory)
    
    return bid_price, ask_price
```

**Challenges**: Market making requires sophisticated risk management to handle inventory risk and adverse selection. High-frequency market makers also need cutting-edge technology to compete effectively.

## The Quantitative Advantage

What makes quantitative trading so powerful? Why have algorithmic strategies come to dominate modern financial markets? The answer lies in several key advantages that mathematical approaches have over human decision-making:

### 1. Elimination of Emotional Bias

Human traders are subject to a wide range of cognitive biases that can impair their decision-making:

**Loss Aversion**: People feel the pain of losses more acutely than the pleasure of equivalent gains, leading them to hold losing positions too long and cut winning positions too short.

**Overconfidence**: Traders often overestimate their ability to predict market movements, leading to excessive risk-taking and insufficient diversification.

**Herding Behavior**: People tend to follow the crowd, buying when markets are rising and selling when they're falling, often at exactly the wrong times.

**Anchoring**: Traders may become fixated on certain price levels or recent events, preventing them from adapting to new information.

Quantitative strategies, by contrast, follow pre-defined rules based on mathematical analysis. They don't get scared during market downturns or overexcited during rallies. They execute their strategies consistently, regardless of market conditions or recent performance.

### 2. Processing Power and Speed

Modern quantitative trading systems can process vast amounts of information in milliseconds. They can:

- Monitor thousands of securities simultaneously
- Analyze complex relationships between different markets
- React to new information instantly
- Execute trades with perfect timing and precision

Consider high-frequency trading strategies that can complete entire trading cycles in microseconds. No human trader could possibly match this speed and precision.

### 3. Systematic Risk Management

Quantitative strategies incorporate risk management into their core design. Every position is sized according to mathematical principles, portfolio risk is continuously monitored, and stop-loss rules are executed automatically. This systematic approach to risk management helps preserve capital during difficult periods and compound returns over time.

### 4. Scalability

Once developed and validated, quantitative strategies can often be scaled to manage much larger amounts of capital than discretionary approaches. The same algorithm that works with $1 million might work with $100 million or even $1 billion, subject to market capacity constraints.

### 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation

Modern quantitative strategies can adapt to changing market conditions using machine learning and other advanced techniques. They can identify new patterns, adjust their parameters, and even discover entirely new trading opportunities without human intervention.

## The Challenges of Quantitative Trading

Despite its advantages, quantitative trading faces several significant challenges:

### 1. Data Quality and Availability

Quantitative strategies are only as good as the data they're based on. Poor quality data can lead to false signals and substantial losses. Moreover, as markets become more efficient, it becomes increasingly difficult to find new sources of alpha. This has led to an arms race in alternative data, with firms spending millions to acquire satellite imagery, social media feeds, and other non-traditional data sources.

### 2. Model Risk

All quantitative models are simplifications of reality. They make assumptions about how markets work, and these assumptions may not always hold. When models fail, they can fail spectacularly. The 2007 "quant meltdown," when many statistical arbitrage strategies suffered simultaneous losses, illustrated how model risk can affect multiple strategies at once.

### 3. Competition and Alpha Decay

As more firms adopt quantitative approaches, profitable strategies become crowded and their returns diminish. This phenomenon, known as "alpha decay," means that quantitative traders must constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition. Strategies that worked well in the past may become less effective or even unprofitable as more capital pursues the same opportunities.

### 4. Technology Risk

Quantitative trading relies heavily on technology, making it vulnerable to system failures, connectivity issues, and cyber attacks. A malfunctioning algorithm can execute thousands of erroneous trades in seconds, potentially causing massive losses.

### 5. Regulatory Scrutiny

As algorithmic trading has grown, it has attracted increasing attention from regulators. High-frequency trading, in particular, has been blamed for increased market volatility and unfair advantages over traditional investors. Regulatory changes can significantly impact the profitability of quantitative strategies.

## The Human Element in Quantitative Trading

Despite its systematic nature, quantitative trading still requires significant human expertise. Successful quant firms need:

**Quantitative Researchers**: PhD-level scientists who develop new models and strategies. These researchers typically have backgrounds in mathematics, physics, statistics, or economics.

**Data Scientists**: Experts in machine learning and big data analytics who can extract insights from massive datasets.

**Software Engineers**: Programmers who build the trading systems, ensure they operate reliably, and optimize them for speed and efficiency.

**Risk Managers**: Professionals who monitor portfolio risk, ensure compliance with risk limits, and develop new risk management techniques.

**Portfolio Managers**: Experienced traders who oversee strategy implementation, manage client relationships, and make high-level allocation decisions.

The most successful quantitative trading firms combine cutting-edge technology with deep human expertise. They create environments where brilliant minds can collaborate to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions.

## The Future of Quantitative Trading

As we look to the future, several trends are likely to shape the evolution of quantitative trading:

### 1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Machine learning is already transforming quantitative trading, but we're still in the early stages. Future developments in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other AI techniques will likely enable more sophisticated pattern recognition and decision-making.

### 2. Alternative Data Explosion

The amount of data available for analysis continues to grow exponentially. Satellite imagery, social media, IoT sensors, and countless other sources are generating new data streams that could provide trading alpha. The challenge will be separating signal from noise in this data deluge.

### 3. Quantum Computing

While still in its infancy, quantum computing could revolutionize quantitative trading by enabling the solution of optimization problems that are currently intractable. Portfolio optimization, risk management, and options pricing could all benefit from quantum algorithms.

### 4. Regulatory Evolution

As algorithmic trading continues to grow, regulatory frameworks will likely evolve to address concerns about market stability and fairness. This could create new constraints but also new opportunities for compliant strategies.

### 5. Democratization of Quant Trading

Technology platforms are making quantitative trading tools available to smaller firms and individual investors. This democratization could lead to more innovation but also increased competition for traditional strategies.

## Getting Started in Quantitative Trading

For those interested in entering the field of quantitative trading, here's a roadmap for getting started:

### Educational Foundation

**Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistics form the foundation of quantitative trading. Focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than just memorizing formulas.

**Programming**: Python is the most popular language in quantitative finance, but R, C++, and Julia are also valuable. Learn not just syntax but also best practices for writing clean, efficient code.

**Finance**: Understand how financial markets work, including market microstructure, derivatives, and portfolio theory. Read classic texts like "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" and "The Intelligent Investor."

**Statistics and Machine Learning**: Modern quantitative trading relies heavily on statistical analysis and machine learning. Study regression analysis, time series analysis, and modern ML techniques.

### Practical Experience

**Paper Trading**: Start by developing and testing strategies using historical data. Many platforms offer paper trading environments where you can test strategies without risking real money.

**Competitions**: Participate in quantitative trading competitions like those offered by Quantopian, QuantConnect, or Kaggle. These provide real-world experience and networking opportunities.

**Internships**: Seek internships at quantitative hedge funds, investment banks, or fintech companies. Even if you don't land a top-tier internship, any exposure to real trading environments is valuable.

### Building Your Skills

**Read Widely**: Study both academic papers and practical guides. Follow quantitative trading blogs and forums to stay current with industry developments.

**Network**: Attend conferences, join professional organizations, and connect with others in the field. The quantitative trading community is surprisingly collaborative, and many professionals are willing to share insights with newcomers.

**Build Projects**: Develop your own trading strategies and build a portfolio of work you can showcase to potential employers. Document your process, including your hypotheses, methodology, and results.

## Conclusion: The Art and Science of Quantitative Trading

Quantitative trading represents the cutting edge of finance, where mathematical rigor meets market reality. It's a field that demands intellectual curiosity, technical expertise, and the humility to admit when models are wrong. Success requires not just understanding complex mathematics and programming sophisticated algorithms, but also appreciating the human psychology and market dynamics that drive price movements.

The practitioners of quantitative trading are the modern-day alchemists of finance, seeking to transmute data into gold through the application of mathematical principles. They work in glass towers filled with humming servers, their strategies executing millions of trades while they sleep. Yet for all their technological sophistication, they remain acutely aware that markets are ultimately driven by human behavior—fear and greed, hope and despair, rational calculation and irrational exuberance.

As we've seen in this introduction, quantitative trading is both an art and a science. The science lies in the rigorous application of mathematical and statistical principles. The art lies in knowing which principles to apply, how to interpret results in the context of ever-changing markets, and when to trust—or distrust—what the models are telling you.

The field continues to evolve rapidly, driven by advances in technology, the availability of new data sources, and the constant pressure to find new sources of alpha in increasingly efficient markets. For those with the skills and temperament to succeed, it offers the opportunity to be at the forefront of financial innovation, to solve complex puzzles, and to be rewarded handsomely for their efforts.

But perhaps most importantly, quantitative trading offers the chance to impose order on chaos, to find patterns in randomness, and to profit from the eternal dance between fear and greed that drives all financial markets. In a world where information moves at the speed of light and fortunes can be made or lost in milliseconds, the quantitative trader stands as a testament to the power of human intellect enhanced by mathematical precision and technological prowess.

The journey into quantitative trading is challenging but rewarding. It requires dedication, continuous learning, and the ability to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. But for those who master its principles and practices, it offers entry into one of the most intellectually stimulating and financially rewarding fields in modern finance.

As we proceed to the next chapter, we'll dive deep into the mathematical foundations that underpin all quantitative trading strategies. We'll explore the elegant mathematical structures that allow us to model market behavior, optimize portfolios, and manage risk with mathematical precision. The journey from basic algebra to advanced stochastic calculus may seem daunting, but each step builds upon the last, creating a powerful toolkit for understanding and exploiting financial markets.
