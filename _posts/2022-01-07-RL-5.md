This is a tutorial to create your own Q-learning environment.

We need opencv for this, so make sure to 'pip install' it. We also need a python imaging library, called pillow, so also install that before starting.

## 💢 Intro

This environment is like a snakes game with a slight modification. There is a player, represented
as a blue blob, an enemy, represented as a red blob, and food, represented as a green blob.
When the environment renders, we will see all these 3 blobs on a black background. When we start
training, we will start to see results. Result analysis :

1. If red and blue blob remain on sceen, means our agent got to the food
2. If green and red blob remain, means our agent got to the enemy
   <br>

🎨 Interesting thing to note : We will restrict our agent's movement to diagonals only, so it
can't move up or down in a straight line. But, it will learn on its own, to use the boundaries
of the grid (edges of the render window), even though it doesn't know about it, to correct
its direction and go to the required place.

```python
    import numpy as np
    from PIL import Image as Img
    import cv2
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pickle
    from matplotlib import style
    import time

    style.use("ggplot")
```

## 💢 Constants

```python
    SIZE = 10 # make a 10x10 grid

    HM_EPISODES = 25000 # number of episodes

    MOVE_PENALTY = 1
    ENEMY_PENALTY = 300
    FOOD_REWARD = 25

    epsilon = 0.9
    EPS_DECAY = 0.9998
    SHOW_EVERY = 500

    LEARNING_RATE = 0.1
    DISCOUNT = 0.95

    PLAYER_N = 1
    FOOD_N = 2
    ENEMY_N = 3
```

## 💢 Add Q-table

We can add an existing Q-table by writing the full path in place of 'None' :

```python
    start_q_table = None

    # Defining colour for our objects. This is in BGR format.

    d = {1: (255, 175, 0),
        2: (0, 255, 0),
        3: (0, 0, 255)}
```

## 💢 Blob class

Now we need a blob class. All the blobs have a lot of same attributes, like, movement directions, starting locations, etc.
We are defining observation in our environment as the relative location of food, and the relative location of the enemy. So, we need to create a blob class to handle all of the repeated things with ease.

Few things to note here that we want to avoid:

1. The player could spawn on the food;
2. Player could spawn on enemy;
3. Enemy could spawn on the food.

We want to avoid all the above scenarios. But since we are making a very simple environment here, we won't worry about that for now.

```python
    class Blob:
        def __init__(self):
            self.x = np.random.randint(0, SIZE)
            self.y = np.random.randint(0, SIZE)

        def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.x}, {self.y}"

        def __sub__(self, other):
            return (self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
```

We need to make a method that interacts with other methods in case we want to add more players. Note, the moves we are adding here only allow diagonal movement. To make a blob go up-down, or, side-to-side, add the codes for only x and only y.

```python
        def action(self, choice):
            if choice == 0:
                self.move(x = 1, y = 1)
            elif choice == 1:
                self.move(x = -1, y = -1)
            elif choice == 2:
                self.move(x = -1, y = 1)
            elif choice == 3:
                self.move(x = 1, y = -1)
```

## 💢 Random movements

We should be able to move randomly if 'not' value is passed, or very specifically otherwise. This can attain the value 0, hence random movement can be up-down.

```python
    def move(self, x = False, y = False):
        if not x:
            self.x += np.random.randint(-1, 2)
        else:
            self.x += x
        if not y:
            self.y += np.random.randint(-1, 2)
        else:
            self.y += y
```

Since we are creating a 10 x 10 grid, we need to create movement boundaries for our agent.

```python
        if self.x < 0:
            self.x = 0
        elif self.x > SIZE - 1:
            self.x = SIZE - 1

        if self.y < 0:
            self.y = 0
        elif self.y > SIZE - 1:
            self.y = SIZE - 1
```

## 💢 Creating a Q-table

We are finished with our blob class. Now, we either want to create a Q-table, or load an existing one.

Also, our observation space will look like :<br>

(x1, y1), (x2, y2)

So, to iterate through every possibility, we need 4 nested FOR loops.

```python
    if start_q_table is None:
        q_table = {}

        for x1 in range(-SIZE + 1, SIZE):
            for y1 in range(-SIZE + 1, SIZE):
                for x2 in range(-SIZE + 1, SIZE):
                    for y2 in range(-SIZE + 1, SIZE):
                        q_table[((x1, y1), (x2, y2))] = [np.random.uniform(-5, 0) for i in range(4)]
    else:
        with open(start_q_table, "rb") as f:
            q_table = pickle.load(f)
```

## 💢 Training the model

We shall begin our training now.

```python
    episode_rewards = []

    for episode in range(HM_EPISODES):
        player = Blob()
        food = Blob()
        enemy = Blob()

        if episode % SHOW_EVERY == 0:
            print(f"on # {episode}, epsilon : {epsilon}")
            print(f"{SHOW_EVERY} ep mean {np.mean(episode_rewards[-SHOW_EVERY:])}")
            show = True
        else:
            show = False

        episode_reward = 0

        for i in range(200):
            obs = (player - food, player - enemy)   # Operator overloading
            if np.random.random() > epsilon:
                action = np.argmax(q_table[obs])
            else:
                action = np.random.randint(0, 4)

            player.action(action)
```

Later, we might wanna make the enemy and the food move. For that, use the commands below :

```python
    enemy.move()
    food.move()
```

But for training purposes now, it is better to not let them move initially in order to keep
things simple.

We need to assign the rewards to actions :

```python
            if player.x == enemy.x and player.y == enemy.y:
                reward = -ENEMY_PENALTY
            elif player.x == food.x and player.y == food.y:
                reward = FOOD_REWARD
            else:
                reward = -MOVE_PENALTY
```

To make our Q function, we need to be able to make a new observation based on the movement :

```python
            new_obs = (player - food, player - enemy)
            max_future_q = np.max(q_table[new_obs])
            current_q = q_table[obs][action]
```

Calculating our Q-function :

```python
            if reward == FOOD_REWARD:
                new_q = FOOD_REWARD
            elif reward == -ENEMY_PENALTY:
                new_q = -ENEMY_PENALTY
            else:
                new_q = (1 - LEARNING_RATE) * current_q + LEARNING_RATE * (reward + DISCOUNT * max_future_q)

            q_table[obs][action] = new_q
```

The Q-learning part is over. We now want to see the environment and track the metrics. Initially, we get a black environment because we initialize with all zeros :

```python
            if show:
                env = np.zeros((SIZE, SIZE, 3), dtype = np.uint8)
```

If we want to add multiple foods, the dictionary method will help :

```python
                env[food.y][food.x] = d[FOOD_N]

                env[player.y][player.x] = d[PLAYER_N]
                env[enemy.y][enemy.x] = d[ENEMY_N]
```

## 💢 Converting grid to image

We get a coloured grid, but it is still just a 10 x 10 grid. We want to make it an image now.

Even though we define 'RGB' below, the image is still defined as 'BGR', this is the reason we defined colours in the 'BGR' format in the beginning :

```python
                img = Img.fromarray(env, "RGB")

                img = img.resize((300, 300))
                cv2.imshow("", np.array(img))
                if reward == FOOD_REWARD or reward == -ENEMY_PENALTY:
                    if cv2.waitKey(500) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
                        break
                else:
                    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
                        break

            episode_reward += reward
            if reward == FOOD_REWARD or reward == -ENEMY_PENALTY:
                break

        episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)
        epsilon *= EPS_DECAY

    moving_avg = np.convolve(episode_rewards, np.ones((SHOW_EVERY, )) / SHOW_EVERY, mode = "valid")

    plt.plot([i for i in range(len(moving_avg))], moving_avg)
    plt.ylabel(f"Reward {SHOW_EVERY} mov_avg")
    plt.xlabel("Episode")
    plt.show()
```

Saving our Q-table :

```python
    with open(f"qt-{int(time.time())}.pickle", "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(q_table, f)
```
